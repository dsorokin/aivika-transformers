Transformers for the [Aivika] [1] simulation library

The [Aivika Transformers] [2] package adds the monad and other computation transformers to 
the Aivika library. This is a generalization of the simulation library.

While the parent library Aivika is licensed under BSD3, this package Aivika Transformers
has already a dual license. The package can be licensed either under GPL3 or a commercial
license. Please contact <mailto:david.sorokin@gmail.com> for detail.
