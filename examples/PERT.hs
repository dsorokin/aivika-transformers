-- Example: Analysis of a PERT-type Network 
--
-- It is described in different sources [1, 2]. So, this is chapter 14 of [2] and section 7.11 of [1].
--
-- PERT is a technique for evaluating and reviewing a project consisting of
-- interdependent activities. A number of books have been written that describe
-- PERT modeling and analysis procedures. A PERT network activity descriptions
-- are given in a table stated below. All activity times will be assumed to be
-- triangularly distributed. For ease of description, activities have been
-- aggregated. The activities relate to power units, instrumentation, and
-- a new assembly and involve standard types of operations.
-- 
-- In the following description of the project, activity numbers are given
-- in parentheses. At the beginning of the project, three parallel activities
-- can be performed that involve: the disassembly of power units and
-- instrumentation (1); the installation of a new assembly (2); and
-- the preparation for a retrofit check (3). Cleaning, inspecting, and
-- repairing the power units (4) and calibrating the instrumentation (5)
-- can be done only after the power units and instrumentation have been
-- disassembled. Thus, activities 4 and 5 must follow activity 1 in the network.
-- Following the installation of the new assembly (2) and after the instrumentation
-- have been calibrated (5), a check of interfaces (6) and a check of
-- the new assembly (7) can be made. The retrofit check (9) can be made
-- after the assembly is checked (7) and the preparation for the retrofit
-- check (3) has been completed. The assembly and test of power units (8)
-- can be performed following the cleaning and maintenance of power units (4).
-- The project is considered completed when all nine activities are completed.
-- Since activities 6, 8, and 9 require the other activities to precede them,
-- their completion signifies the end of the project. This is indicated on
-- the network by having activities 6, 8, and 9 incident to node 6, the sink
-- node for the project. The objective of this example is to illustrate
-- the procedures for using Aivika to model and simulate project planning network.
