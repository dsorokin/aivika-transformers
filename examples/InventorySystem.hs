-- Example: Inventory System with Lost Sales and Backorders 
--
-- It is described in different sources [1, 2]. So, this is chapter 11 of [2] and section 6.7 of [1].
--
-- A large discount house is planning to install a system to control the inventory of
-- a particular radio. The time between demands for a radio is exponentially distributed
-- with a mean time of 0.2 weeks. In the case where customers demand the radio when it
-- is not in stock, 80 percent will go to another nearby discount house to find it, thereby
-- representing lost sales, while the other 20 percent will backorder the radio and wait
-- for the next shipment arrival. The store employs a periodic review-reorder point
-- inventory system where the inventory status is reviewed every four weeks to decide if
-- an order should be placed. The company policy is to order up to the stock control level
-- of 72 radios whenever the inventory position, consisting of the radios in stock plus
-- the radios on order minus the radios on backorder, is found to be less than or equal to
-- the reorder point of 18 radios. The procurement lead time (the time from the placement
-- of an order to its receipt) is constant and requires three weeks.
--
-- The objective of this example is to simulate the inventory system for a period of six
-- years (312 weeks) to obtain statistics on the following quantities:
--
--   1) number of radios in stock;
--   2) inventory position;
--   3) safety stock (radios in stock at order receipt times); and
--   4) time between lost sales.
--
-- The initial conditions for the simulation are an inventory position of 72 and no
-- initial backorders. In order to reduce the bias in the statistics due to the initial
-- starting conditions, all the statistics are to be cleared at the end of the first year
-- of the six year simulation period.
