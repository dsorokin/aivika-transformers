-- Example: Machine Tool with Breakdowns 
--
-- It is described in different sources [1, 2]. So, this is chapter 13 of [2] and section 6.12 of [1].
--
-- Jobs arrive to a machine tool on the average of one per hour. The distribution of 
-- these interarrival times is exponential. During normal operation, the jobs are 
-- processed on a first-in, first-out basis. The time to process a job in hours is 
-- normally distributed with a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.1. In addition 
-- to the processing time, there is a set up time that is uniformly distributed between 
-- 0.2 and 0.5 of an hour. Jobs that have been processed by the machine tool are routed 
-- to a different section of the shop and are considered to have left the machine tool 
-- area.
-- 
-- The machine tool experiences breakdowns during which time it can no longer process 
-- jobs. The time between breakdowns is normally distributed with a mean of 20 hours 
-- and a standard deviation of 2 hours. When a breakdown occurs, the job being processed 
-- is removed from the machine tool and is placed at the head of the queue of jobs 
-- waiting to be processed. Jobs preempted restart from the point at which they were 
-- interrupted.
-- 
-- When the machine tool breaks down, a repair process is initiated which is 
-- accomplished in three phases. Each phase is exponentially distributed with a mean of 
-- 3/4 of an hour. Since the repair time is the sum of independent and identically 
-- distributed exponential random variables, the repair time is Erlang distributed. 
-- The machine tool is to be analyzed for 500 hours to obtain information on 
-- the utilization of the machine tool and the time required to process a job. 
-- Statistics are to be collected for thousand simulation runs.
